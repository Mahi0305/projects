Project Title: 
--------------
Setup of a Personal VPC with NAT Gateway on AWS.

Objective: 
----------
To create a secure and isolated network environment on AWS with controlled internet access using a NAT gateway.

Technologies Used:
------------------
	1.Amazon VPC
	2.NAT Gateway
	3.Internet Gateway
	4.Subnets (Public and Private)
	5.Route Tables
	6.Security Groups

Description:
------------
As part of my learning experience with AWS, I designed and set up a personal Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a NAT gateway to manage internet access for instances in private subnets.

Key Responsibilities:
---------------------
	
1.VPC Creation:
---------------
   Created a custom VPC to provide an isolated network environment with specific CIDR block allocation.

2.Subnet Configuration:
-----------------------
   Configured both public and private subnets within the VPC, organizing resources based on their need for internet access.

3.Internet and NAT Gateway Setup:
---------------------------------
   Set up an Internet Gateway to enable internet connectivity for instances in the public subnet.
   Deployed a NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow instances in the private subnet to initiate outbound internet traffic securely.
	
4.Route Tables Management:
--------------------------
   Configured route tables to direct traffic between the subnets, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway, ensuring proper routing of data.

5.Security Groups and NACLs:
----------------------------
   Implemented Security Groups and Network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing the security of the VPC.

Outcome:
--------
Successfully created a personal VPC with a NAT gateway, demonstrating a solid understanding of networking concepts in AWS. This project helped me gain hands-on experience in designing secure and scalable network architectures.
