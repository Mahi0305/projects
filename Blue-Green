Project Title:
--------------
Implementation of Blue-Green Deployment Model on AWS

Objective:
----------
To ensure zero-downtime deployment and seamless upgrades for web applications using EC2, RDS, and Elastic Beanstalk.

Technologies Used:
------------------
	1.AWS EC2
	2.AWS RDS
	3.AWS Elastic Beanstalk
	4.Amazon Route 53
	5.AWS CloudFormation
	6.AWS CodePipeline
	7.AWS CodeDeploy

Description:
------------
Implemented a robust blue-green deployment model for a web application hosted on AWS, leveraging EC2 instances, RDS for database management, and Elastic Beanstalk for 
application deployment. The primary goal was to ensure minimal downtime and risk during application upgrades and to facilitate seamless rollback capabilities in case of deployment issues.

Key Responsibilities:
---------------------

1.Architecture Design:
----------------------
   Designed the architecture for the blue-green deployment model, ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.
   Utilized AWS CloudFormation to create and manage the necessary infrastructure components.

2.Deployment Strategy:
----------------------
   Configured two identical environments (blue and green) in Elastic Beanstalk to facilitate smooth transitions during deployments.
   Set up EC2 instances within each environment, ensuring they were properly load-balanced and auto-scaled to handle varying traffic loads.
   Used RDS for the database, ensuring that both environments had access to a common database instance to avoid data inconsistencies.

3.Automation and Orchestration:
-------------------------------
   Implemented AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy to automate the deployment process, reducing manual intervention and the potential for errors.
   Configured automated testing and validation steps within the pipeline to ensure the integrity and performance of the application before switching traffic.

4.Traffic Routing and Management:
---------------------------------
   Utilized Amazon Route 53 to manage DNS routing, enabling smooth traffic switchovers between the blue and green environments.
   Ensured proper monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch to track application performance and health.

5.Testing and Rollback:
-----------------------
   Conducted comprehensive testing in the green environment to validate new application versions before routing production traffic.
   Established rollback procedures to quickly revert to the blue environment in case of any issues, minimizing impact on end-users.

Outcome:
--------
The implementation of the blue-green deployment model significantly improved the deployment process, reducing downtime to nearly zero and allowing for rapid and reliable 
application updates. The project demonstrated the effectiveness of using AWS services to create a highly available and resilient deployment architecture.
